# Aptabase Privacy Policy

### 1. Introduction

Aptabase is built with privacy in mind and we made this privacy policy exceptionally short and easy to understand so you know exactly what data we collect and how we process it.

This privacy notice explains how we, Sumbit Labs Ltd., process personal data in our business as per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection and privacy laws applicable to our business.

### 2. As a end-user of an app built with Aptabase

Your privacy is the most important thing to us. We are committed to protecting your privacy and we will never let application developers track you.

Aptabase SDK does not collect any device specific identifier such as Device ID, Hostname or Hardware Identifier. Instead, Aptabase generates a unique user identifier on the server based on a strong hash of client's IP Address and a strong salt, which differs for each app and is thrown away every 24 hours.

> User ID = SHA(Client IP + User Agent + Daily Rotated Salt)

This is a common privacy-friendly strategy that makes it impossible for application developers to correlate sessions that happens throughout different days or apps. Application developers can only Aptabase to discover insights into how their apps are being used without identifying the user being each action.

All analytics data collected by apps are stored in Aptabase for up to 5 years. You cannot request us to delete your data, simply because it's impossible to know what data relates to you.

### 3. As an app developer using Aptabase

We only collect the bare minimum data required to provide our service. Your data may be shared with third parties to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, but we will never sell your data to third parties.

**Your name and email address** This information is provided by you when you sign up for an Aptabase account. This is required to sign in and operate your account.

**GitHub and Google sign-in** You may choose to sign in to Aptabase using your GitHub or Google account. We only store your account ID and email address to facilitate the sign-in process. We do not ask for additional permissions on your account.

### 4, Changes

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our company blog or social media profiles.
