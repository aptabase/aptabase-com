# Aptabase Privacy Policy

### 1. Introduction

Aptabase is built with privacy in mind and we made this privacy policy exceptionally short and easy to understand so you know exactly what data we collect and how we process it.

This privacy notice explains how we, Sumbit Labs Limited (the corporation behind Aptabase), process personal data in our business as per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection and privacy laws applicable to our business.

### As an end user of an app instrumented with Aptabase

Your privacy is the most important thing to us. We are committed to protecting your privacy and we will never let application developers track you.

Aptabase does not track usage across sessions, meaning that if you open an app twice a day, there is no way for us to know that those sessions belong to the same user. We do NOT apply pseudonymization techniques to your personal identification, simply because we don't collect it. You can't request us to delete your data, because it's impossible to know what data relates to you.

### As a developer using Aptabase

We only collect the bare minimum data required to provide our service. Your data may be shared with third parties to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, but we will never sell your data to third parties.
