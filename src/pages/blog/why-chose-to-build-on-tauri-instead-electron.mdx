About A year ago (July/2022) I decided to experiment with building a Desktop application.

I wasn't happy with the other apps in this space and I thought I could build something better. I've been a full stack developer for a long time, but I never built a Desktop application. I had no idea where to start.

My first thought was to build with SwiftUI. Developers love native apps, and I've always wanted to learn Swift. However, building on SwiftUI would limit my audience to macOS users only. I had a feeling that most of my audience would be on macOS, but why limit myself when I could build a cross-platform app? I decided to look for alternatives.

## What about Electron?

I that Electron was a thing and that many of the popular apps I use daily (including the editor I'm using to write this blog post) are built on Electron. It seemed like a perfect fit for what I was trying to do.

- âœ… Cross-platform?
- âœ… Works with React + Typescript
- âœ… Very popular = lots of resources
- âœ… Huge package ecosystem

The other benefit of building on Electron meant I'd be able to focus on building the app rather than learning something completely new. I love learning new languages and frameworks, but I wanted to build something useful quickly. I'd still have to learn about Electron, but it wouldn't be as steep as learning a new language.

## Let's get started!

I was settled. [Aptakube](https://aptakube.com) was going to be built with Electron.

I normally don't read the documentation. I know I should, but I don't. However, I always read the `Getting Started` section when starting with a framework for the first time. That is what I did with Electron too.

Popular frameworks have a `npx create-SOMETHING` that will quickly bootstrap an app. Next.js, Expo, Remix and a bunch of others. These `boostrapping tools` are great because they allow you to get started quickly, and they give you a bunch of options like: Do you want Typescript or JavaScript? Do you want to use a CSS framework? Do you this or that? Prettier or ESLint? The list goes on. It's such a great developer experience that I wish every framework had one.

Does Electron have one?

Apparently it doesn't, or at least I haven't found it, certainly not on the `Getting Started` section.

What I found instead was a `quick-start` template. You can just clone from Git, install the dependencies, and you're good to go.

However, it's not TypeScript, there is no bundler, no CSS framework, no linting, no formatting, no nothing. It's just a bare bones app that opens a window. Sure, I can add all those things by myself, but why would I spend time on it when I could be building the app? I was disappointed.

I found a bunch (dozens?) of templates to bootstrap an electron app. I tried about 5 of them. Some were actually good, but I was a bit put off by the fact that most templates were too opinionated and installed way too many dependencies that I didn't even know what they were used for. Some didn't even work at all as they've been abandoned for years.

In summary, it was a such a painful experience to simply get started.

## What now?

I was frustrated and went for a walk to think about what to do next. Yes, that's literally what I did. I went for a walk, which is something I do when I'm stuck on a problem.

For some reason I opened Twitter, and I saw a tweet from [Tauri](https://twitter.com/TauriApps) about the 1.0 release. I had no idea what Tauri was, but I was curious. I went to their website, and I was blown away. ðŸ¤¯ It was exactly what I was looking for.

I was excited again. Do you know why? Because of the `npm create tauri-app` right there on the home page.

    command.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I decided to give it a try. I ran `npm create tauri-app` and guess what? It did exactly what I wanted.

At the end of the process I could simply run `npm run dev` and I had a working app with hot-reloading, TypeScript, Vite and Solid.js, pretty much everything I needed to get started. I was impressed, and excited to keep building.

I had to add Prettier, Linters, Tailwind and all that kind of stuff, but I'm used to it and it was easier than in Electron. I'll explain why later.

If you create a Tauri app today, you'll get the following experience, which is not much different that it was on the 1.0 release.

## Getting started (again ðŸ˜…), but with Tauri

While in Electron I could build the whole app with just JavaScript/HTML/CSS, in Tauri you the backend is Rust and only the frontend is JavaScript. That meant I had to learn Rust, which I was excited to do.

I've programmed professionally in 7+ languages, so I thought learning Rust would be a walk in the park.

I was wrong. I was so wrong. Rust is hard, like really hard, or at least it was for me!

One year later, more than 20 releases of my app were released, and I still can't say I truly know Rust. I know enough to be constantly shipping new features on a regular basis, but I'm still learning so much every time I have to write something in Rust. GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have been a huge help, and I still use them both a lot.

## The Rust learning curve

There is something in Tauri that makes this process a lot easier.

`Commands` are like the bridge between the frontend and backend. You can define commands in your Tauri backend using Rust and call them from JavaScript. The neat thing is that Tauri itself provides a bunch of commands that you can use out of the box. For example, you can open a file dialog, read/update/delete a file, make HTTP requests and a bunch of other interactions with the operating system.

This alone means you a lot of the time you don't have to write ant Rust code at all. I've seen quite a few Tauri apps that are 95% JavaScript.

On top of that, you also have `Plugins`, which are basically Rust libraries that you can use in your app. There are a bunch of plugins already available, you can also write your own, but when you take a plugin from the community they often come with a bunch of commands that you can use in your app, which again reduce the amount of Rust code you have to write.

## So how does Tauri compare to Electron?

While they both look somewhat similar, there are some fundamental differences that I think are worth mentioning. There are lot more than the ones I've covered here, but from an Application Developer point of view, these are the ones that I think are the most important.

### 1. Programming Language and Ecosystem

In Electron, your backend is a Node.js process and your frontend is Chromium, which a web developer can build a desktop app with just JavaScript/HTML/CSS. There's a huge ecosystem of libraries on NPM and there is just so much content about it on the internet that makes the learning process a lot easier.

While it's generally seen as a good thing being able to share code between backend and frontend, it can also get confusing as developers might try to use backend functions on the frontend and vice versa. This is something that I've seen a lot in Electron apps, as well as in Next.js when using RSC.

In contrast, Tauri's backend is Rust and the frontend is also a webview (more on this next). While there's a significant amount of Rust libraries, it's nowhere near the amount of libraries available on NPM. The Rust community is also a lot smaller than the JavaScript community, which means there's less content about it on the internet.

**My opinion:** I love the clear separation of backend and frontend. If I'm writing rust code I know it'll be running as an OS process and I have access to network, file system and a bunch of other things. While everything I have in JavaScript is guaranteed to be running on the frontend. Learning Rust has not been easy, but I'm enjoying the process, and I'm learning a lot of new things!

### 2. Webview

In Electron, the frontend is a Chromium webview that is bundled with the app. This means if your app is using Electron version XYZ, you know that the Chromium version used by your app will always be the same, regardless of the operating system. This comes with a few benefits, but also some drawbacks.

The biggest benefit is the consistency of knowing what version of Chromium your app is using, so you know what features are available and if something works on macOS, it'll likely work on Windows and Linux as well. The drawback however is that you have to bundle Chromium with your app, which means your app will be a lot bigger, as well as sometimes being slower to start.

Tauri takes a drastically different approach. Instead of bundling Chromium with your app, it uses the operating system's default webview. This means that on macOS your app will use WebKit (Safari's engine), on Windows it'll use WebView2 (which is based on Chromium) and on Linux it'll use WebKitGTK (same as Safari's).

The end result is an extremely small app size that feels superfast!

As a reference, my Tauri app weights 24.7MB on macOS, while my competitor's app (Electron) weights 1.3GB. ðŸ˜±

Why does it matter?

- It's so much faster to download and install
- Costs less to host and distribute (note: I run on AWS)
- Users have a "this feels like a native app" moment. I often get asked if my app is built with Swift ðŸ˜Š
- Security is handled by the OS. If there's a security issue with WebKit, Apple will release a security update and my app will simply use it. I don't have to ship and updated version of my app to fix it.

**My opinion:** I like the fact that my app is so small and fast. I was initially worried about the lack of consistency between operating systems, which means I need to test my app on all 3 operating systems, but I haven't had any major issues so far. Web developers are used to this anyway, as they have to test their web apps on different browsers. Bundlers and polyfills also help a lot with this!

### 3. Plugins

I briefly mentioned this before, but I think it's worth going into more details. Plugins are such an amazing feature of Tauri. It allows developers to compose applications by putting together different plugins. These plugins can either be open source, or even defined within the app. It's a nice way of structuring an app, and it makes it easy to share code between apps too.

Some examples of plugins you'll find in the Tauri ecosystem:

- [tauri-plugin-log](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-log) - Configurable logging.
- [tauri-plugin-store](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-store) - Configurable logging.
- [tauri-plugin-window-state](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-window-state) - Persist window sizes and positions.
- [window-vibrancy](https://github.com/tauri-apps/window-vibrancy) - Make your windows vibrant.
- [tauri-plugin-sql](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-sql) - Make your windows vibrant.
- [tauri-plugin-aptabase](https://github.com/aptabase/tauri-plugin-aptabase) - Analytics for Tauri apps.
- and a [lot more](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri#plugins)...

This features **could** have been part of Tauri itself, but having it separately means you can pick and choose what you want to use. It also means they can evolve independently, and be replaced with alternatives if needed.

The plugin system was actually the second biggest reason why I chose Tauri, it makes developer experience so much better!

### 4. Feature Parity

When it comes to feature, both Electron and Tauri are very similar. Electron still has a few more features, but Tauri is catching up fast. At least for my use case, Tauri has everything I need.

The only major inconvenience for me was the lack of a `Native Context Menu` API. This is a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4338) by the community and would make Tauri apps feel a lot more native. I'm currently doing this with JS/HTML/CSS which is OK, but could be better. I'm hoping this will be added soon. There's even a $1500 bounty for it! ðŸ¤‘

But other than that, there's plenty in Tauri. Right out the box you get: notifications, tray, menu, dialog, file system, networking, window management, auto updating, packaging, code signing, GitHub actions, sidecars, etc. And if you need something else, you can always write a plugin for it, or use one of the existing ones.

### 5. Mobile

This one came as a surprise to me. At the time I'm writing this, Tauri has experimental support for iOS and Android. It seems like it was always part of the plan, but I didn't know about it when I started my app. I'm not sure if I'll ever use it, but it's nice to know it's there.

This is something that is not possible with Electron, and probably never will be. So if you're planning to build a cross-platform mobile and desktop app, Tauri may be the way to go as you'd likely be able to share a lot of code between them. Designing mobile-first interfaces with web technologies got a lot easier over the years, so building a single interface that could run as a desktop and mobile app is not as crazy as it sounds.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to use Tauri. I'm not saying it's always better than Electron, but if it has the features you need, and you're either confortable with Rust or willing to learn it, I'd say give it a try!

Like mentioned before, you might not even need to write that much code in Rust. You'd actually be surprised by how much you can do with just JavaScript.

In case you're into Kubernetes, go check out my app. It's called [Aptakube](https://aptakube.com) and it's a Kubernetes Desktop Client for macOS, Windows and Linux ðŸ˜Š

I'm also working on an [open source and privacy-friendly analytics platform](https://aptabase.com) for dekstop and mobile apps. We have SDKs for various different frameworks, including Tauri and Electron. Fun fact: The Tauri SDK is packaged as a Tauri Plugin! ðŸ˜„

Lastly, I'm also very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/goenning) (or should I way, X?). Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback, I love talking about Tauri!

Thanks for reading! ðŸ‘‹
