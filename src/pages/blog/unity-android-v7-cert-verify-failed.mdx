When integrating **Aptabase** analytics into your **Unity** game for Android devices, you might encounter SSL certificate errors on older Android versions, particularly Android 7.0 and below. This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up the **Aptabase Unity SDK** while addressing the critical SSL certificate compatibility issues that emerged after **Let's Encrypt**'s certificate transition.


```
Unity   : Curl error 60: Cert verify failed. Certificate is not correctly signed by a trusted CA. UnityTls error code: 7
Unity   : Failed to perform web request due to 0 and response body SSL CA certificate error
Unity   : UnityEngine.DebugLogHandler:Internal_Log(LogType, LogOption, String, Object)
Unity   : AptabaseSDK.<SendWebRequestAsync>d__1:MoveNext()
```

## The SSL Certificate Challenge

Since October 2021, many developers have encountered SSL connection failures when their **Unity** games attempt to communicate with analytics services on older Android devices. This issue comes from **Let's Encrypt**'s transition from the expired **DST Root CA X3** certificate to their newer **ISRG Root X1** and **X2** certificates.

The core issue affects Android devices running versions below 7.1.1 (API level 25). These older devices contain only the **DST Root CA X3** certificate in their trusted certificate store, which expired on September 30, 2021. When your **Unity** game tries to make HTTPS requests to **Aptabase**'s analytics endpoints, these devices can no longer verify the SSL certificates, resulting in connection failures.

### Key Facts:

- Android 7.1.1+ (API 25+) includes the newer **ISRG Root X1** certificates
- Android 7.0 and below only contain the expired **DST Root CA X3** certificate
- SSL requests to services using **Let's Encrypt** certificates will fail on older devices

### Check SSL Certificate Issuer

```
echo | openssl s_client -servername us.aptabase.com -connect us.aptabase.com:443
```

## Setting Up Aptabase Unity SDK

Before addressing the SSL issues, let's set up the **Aptabase Unity SDK** properly.


### Installation

- Open **Unity Package Manager** (Window > Package Manager)
- Click the + button and select **Add Package** from git URL
- Enter: https://github.com/aptabase/aptabase-unity.git

### Configuration

- Get your **App Key** from the **Aptabase** dashboard (Instructions menu)
- Configure the settings at `Aptabase/Resources/AptabaseSettings.Asset`
- Set your **App Key** - the **Host** will be automatically selected based on your key

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using AptabaseSDK;

public class GameAnalytics : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Track app startup - recommended minimum event
        Aptabase.TrackEvent("app_started");
        
        // Track with custom properties
        Aptabase.TrackEvent("level_completed", new Dictionary<string, object> 
        {
            {"level", 1},
            {"score", 1500},
            {"time_seconds", 45.2}
        });
    }
}
```

## Solving Android 7 SSL Certificate Issues

For **Unity** games targeting Android 7.0 and below, you'll need to implement additional certificate handling to ensure analytics tracking works reliably.

### Solution 1: Network Security Configuration (Recommended)

The most effective solution is to use Android's **Network Security Configuration** to explicitly trust the required certificates.

#### Step 1: Update AndroidManifest.xml

Add the network security configuration to your Android manifest:

```xml
<application
    android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
    ... >
    <!-- Your existing application configuration -->
</application>
```

#### Step 2: Create Network Security Configuration

Create `Assets/Plugins/Android/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
        <trust-anchors>
            <!-- Include ISRG Root certificates -->
            <certificates src="@raw/isrg_root_x1" />
            <certificates src="@raw/isrg_root_x2" />
            <!-- Keep system certificates -->
            <certificates src="system" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

#### Step 3: Add Certificate Files

Download and add the certificate files to `Assets/Plugins/Android/res/raw/`:

- **ISRG Root X1**: Download from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.der) and save as `isrg_root_x1.der`
- **ISRG Root X2**: Download from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrg-root-x2.der) and save as `isrg_root_x2.der`

### Solution 2: Custom Certificate Handling in Unity

For more control, you can implement custom certificate validation in your **Unity** C# code:

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

public class SSLCertificateHandler
{
    public static void InitializeSSLCertificates()
    {
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ValidateServerCertificate;
    }

    private static bool ValidateServerCertificate(
        object sender,
        X509Certificate certificate,
        X509Chain chain,
        SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
    {
        // For Aptabase endpoints, allow ISRG Root X1 certificates
        if (IsAptabaseEndpoint(sender) && IsISRGRootCertificate(certificate))
        {
            return true;
        }

        // Use default validation for other certificates
        return sslPolicyErrors == SslPolicyErrors.None;
    }

    private static bool IsAptabaseEndpoint(object sender)
    {
        if (sender is HttpWebRequest request)
        {
            return request.RequestUri.Host.Contains("aptabase.com");
        }
        return false;
    }

    private static bool IsISRGRootCertificate(X509Certificate certificate)
    {
        // Check if certificate is issued by ISRG Root X1
        return certificate.Issuer.Contains("ISRG Root X1") || 
               certificate.Subject.Contains("ISRG Root X1");
    }
}
```
Initialize this in your game's startup:
```csharp
void Awake()
{
    SSLCertificateHandler.InitializeSSLCertificates();
    Aptabase.TrackEvent("app_started");
}
```

## Final notes

Using this setup ensures your app can securely communicate with **Aptabase** even on legacy Android devices that donâ€™t trust newer CAs by default. As Android versions phase out legacy support, consider whether maintaining compatibility with very old devices is worth the added configuration.
